# bits-of-code
Random bits of code which may work. None from running contests (i.e. USACO, CodeArena)
# Part 1: Programming Contests
I will post code for Programming Contests, none of which are active or in use. For example, if a USACO is going on I will not post any solutions.
I wlll post code for PAST contests.
# Part 2: Irrelevant Cringe
If I want to do it, I'll do it to make it look like I am smart when actually I'm not.
This is all just a /r/iamverysmart humble brag.
# Part 3: Training Pages
I'm not going to do a Training Pages question, ever, because the USACO Training Pages are the same for everyone.
