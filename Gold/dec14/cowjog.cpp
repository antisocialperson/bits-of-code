/*******************************************************
 * December 2014, USACO Gold, Question 1 (Cow Jog):
 * 
 * Two cows will be in different lanes if one
 * passes through the other at any point in time, quite
 * obviously. 
 * 
 * We'll know when a cow passes another cow. That's if
 * the speed of one cow is more than the speed of
 * another, and the position of the faster cow is less
 * than the position of the slower cow.
 * 
 * Assign all cows to a lane, and a cow that isn't fast
 * enough will go to a new lane. This can be considered
 * a greedy algorithm.
 * 
 * We can use Longest Increasing Subsequence to solve
 * this question.
